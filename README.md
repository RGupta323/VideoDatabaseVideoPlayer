# VideoDatabaseVideoPlayer

This is repo is an extension of the VideoDatabase repo that I created. 
This will allow the user if they want to play youtube videos through this video player (created by html, css, and java script), it will 
collect data on the videos the user watches. 

There will also be a main interface which the user can play certain videos, instead of entering a number, they can just click on the video 
thumbnail which one they want to see.
